// When a queue entry becomes eligible to process, in nanoseconds since the
// epoch — the scale a commit timestamp uses.
//
// Entries that are ready as soon as they land store `db.vars.commitTs`, which
// resolves at commit time. That's what makes an index on this field scannable
// with a cursor that never has to be rewound: an entry can't appear behind a
// commit timestamp we've already read past. (`_creationTime` can't do this — it
// is assigned when the mutation *starts*, so a slow mutation's row can land
// behind rows that already committed and were read.)
//
// Entries that shouldn't be processed until later store that time directly,
// which sorts after everything committed before then. `v.commitTs()` accepts any
// int64, so both live in one field and one index.
